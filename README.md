🛍️ Product Catalog with Conversational GenAI Assistant

Overview:

This project presents a sleek, responsive Product Catalog web application that showcases products across various categories such as Electronics, Clothing, and Home Decor. The catalog is built using pure HTML and CSS with a focus on clean design, intuitive navigation, and an engaging user experience.

What sets this project apart is the integration of a Conversational AI Assistant, powered by ElevenLabs’ GenAI voice engine, allowing users to interact with the catalog using natural speech. This conversational layer enables users to ask questions about products, availability, and features, or request guidance—simulating a smart virtual shopping assistant.
